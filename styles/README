TASK 5.1 CSS

I find coding css to be the most satisfying programming work. I used more SASS on a personal project so I believe im better at it than the returned assignment may show.
It was harder to figure out how to use SASS well in an already made site.

Changed the different background colors from hex to a scss variable.
Nested some code.
Added mixin style().
Added Arithmetic operator on .card, very simple and useless, tried but couldnt think of any better way to use it.
