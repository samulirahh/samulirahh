      <h2> History of the Edmonton Oilers</h2>

              <p><span id=bold>WHA years (1972-1979)</span> <br>On November 1, 1971, the Edmonton Oilers became 1 of the 12 founding WHA franchises. The original owners were "Wild Bill" Hunter (1920-2002) and partner, Dr. Charles A. "Chuck" Allard (1919-1991) (father of Vancouver attorney Peter Allard) who, a decade later, also brought the SCTV sketch comedy TV series to Edmonton. Hunter also owned the Edmonton Oil Kings, a junior hockey franchise, and founded the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League (now known as the Western Hockey League (WHL)). Hunter's efforts to bring major professional hockey to Edmonton via an expansion NHL franchise had been rebuffed by the NHL. So, he looked to the upstart WHA instead. </p>

                <p><span id=bold>Entry into the NHL (1979-1983)</span><br>
                  Upon joining the NHL, the Oilers were placed in the Campbell Conference's Smythe Division. They were mediocre during the regular season in their first two seasons, finishing sixteenth and fourteenth respectively. However, because 16 of the 21 NHL teams made the playoffs at the time, the Oilers were still able to get their young players experience in the playoffs (they made the playoffs for their first 13 years in the NHL). They won only one playoff series in their first three NHL seasons.</p>

            <p><span id=bold>Dynasty years (1983-1990)</span><br>
              In 1983-84, the Oilers finished first overall in the NHL, winning a franchise record 57 games and earning 119 points (15 points ahead of the second-place Islanders). They were the first team to feature three players with 50 goals (Gretzky, Kurri and Anderson). The team scored a grand total of 446 goals as a team. They started the playoffs strongly by sweeping the Winnipeg Jets in the Smythe Division semifinals. They faced the Calgary Flames and defeated them in seven games in the division finals. They then swept the Minnesota North Stars in the conference finals with the Islanders in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Oilers become the first former WHA team to win the Stanley Cup.

          <p><span id="bold">After Gretzky 1988-1990 </span><br>In a surprising and shocking trade, Gretzky, along with enforcer Marty McSorley and centre Mike Krushelnyski, were traded to the Los Angeles Kings on August 9, 1988. In exchange, the Oilers received US$15 million, young star Jimmy Carson, 1988 first-round draft choice Martin Gelinas, and the Kings' first-round draft picks in 1989, 1991, and 1993. The loss of Gretzky had an immediate impact in 1988-89, as the Oilers were only able to finish in third place in their division.</p>

          <p><span id=bold>McDavid-Draisaitl era (2015-present)</span><br>The Oilers selected Connor McDavid first overall in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. On April 24, Craig MacTavish was removed from his position as general manager and was replaced by former Boston Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli, who was also appointed president of hockey operations as part of other related changes. In addition to these coaching changes, the Oilers also made some changes to their scouting staff on June 22, which saw both head amateur and professional scouts Stu MacGregor and Morey Gare relieved of their duties. </p>
